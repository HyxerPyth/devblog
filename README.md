# devblog

DevBlog is the dedicated website chronicling our mission to simplify campus parking. As two students on this journey, we share our progress from building a site powered by React.js and Python to developing a smart system for analyzing parking lots. Our ultimate goal is realized through the creation of the ParkMe app, designed to streamline the campus parking experience. Join us on this insightful documentation of our development journey.
